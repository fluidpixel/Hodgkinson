Before Luke became a clinical Psychologist, he enjoyed working in television and Defence. These roles gave him exposure to a wide range of situations and led to a deeper understanding of people and their unique experiences. Although his primary expertise is in the assessment of neurodevelopmental conditions, a combination of life experience and training in clinical psychology also allows him to work with a variety of people and ages. Luke is excited to offer psychological services to the people of Rockhampton and surrounding areas.
